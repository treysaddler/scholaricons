- **Name:** Acclaim
  - **Pearson Launch (2014):** Pearson created Acclaim as an enterprise-class badging platform based on the Mozilla Open Badges standard. It was designed to provide a "verifiable, data-rich" way to share academic and professional achievements online.
  - **Credly Merger:** In 2018, Credly (another major digital credential provider) acquired the Acclaim platform from Pearson. For several years, the service was rebranded as "Acclaim by Credly."
  - **Full Integration:** Today, the Acclaim platform has been fully integrated into the Credly brand.
