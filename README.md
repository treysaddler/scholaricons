# What is Scholaricons?

Scholaricons is a specialist icon font for academics. It is forked from [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons) by [James Walsh](https://github.com/jpswalsh). It also includes icons from [Academmunicons](https://github.com/twardoch/academmunicons-font).

**All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners. Use of these names, logos, and brands does not imply endorsement.**

Scholaricons contains icons for tools, websites, and organisations related to academia that are often missing from mainstream font packages. It can be used by itself, but its primary purpose is to be used as a supplementary package alongside a larger icon set. Go to [GitHub Pages](http://treysaddler.github.io/scholaricons) to view the full icon set along with instructions for their use.

## Requesting new icons

New icons can be requested by [creating an issue](https://github.com/treysaddler/scholaricons/issues). Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:

- The logo/icon requested is of **appropriate dimensions** (roughly square).
  - If that doesn't exist, then there's really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a (squarish) logo/icon can be provided.
- An icon of **appropriate resolution** can be provided or linked to.
  - The provided file must be a **vector file** (*e.g.* SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded.
  - These files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon.
  - I don't have time to convert high resolution raster images (*e.g.* JPEG, PNG, GIF), so any requests that aren't in a vector format will be closed.
- The icon can be **reduced to monochrome**.
  - This is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours.
  - In certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found.
