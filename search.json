It was designed to provide a “verifiable, data-rich” way to share academic and professional achievements online.\nCredly Merger: In 2018, Credly (another major digital credential provider) acquired the Acclaim platform from Pearson. For several years, the service was rebranded as “Acclaim by Credly.”\nFull Integration: Today, the Acclaim platform has been fully integrated into the Credly brand."

These authority data represent and describe entities, i.e. persons, corporate bodies, conferences and events, geographic entities, topics and works relating to cultural and academic collections. Libraries in particular use the GND to catalogue publications. However, archives, museums, cultural and academic institutions, and researchers involved in research projects are also increasingly working with the GND. Authority data make cataloguing easier, offer definitive search entries and forge links between different information resources.\n\nEvery entity in the GND features a unique and stable identifier (GND ID). This makes it possible to link the authority data with both each other and external data sets and web resources. This results in a cross-organisational, machine-readable data network.\nMore information about the GND at https://gnd.network\n(above information from: https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html)\n\nNotes: https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons/issues/204\n\nName: GrabCAD\n\nOrganization: \nWebsite: https://grabcad.com/\nDescription: GrabCAD is a leading file sharing platform for engineers.

    "text": "How do I use it?\n\nAlongside Font Awesome\nScholaricons was originally built as a supplement to Font Awesome 5, so the two fonts intentionally share the same metrics. You can style the icons using Font Awesome CSS controls.\nThere are two ways to install Scholaricons on your site. The most reliable way is to place the fonts and css folders on your server and link to the scholaricons.css stylesheet by adding the following to the page header:\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/folder/css/scholaricons.min.css\"/&gt;\nAlternatively, use the jsdelivr CDN to call the most recent version of Scholaricons from the content distribution network.\n\n\nLoad Academicons v1 (latest release in the 1.x.x range; recommended):\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/treysaddler/scholaricons@1/css/scholaricons.min.css\"&gt;\nOr get the latest version (not recommended) using:\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/treysaddler/scholaricons/css/scholaricons.min.css\"&gt;\nCall the icons in the same way as you would using Font Awesome, but replacing fa with si. For example:\n&lt;i class=\"si si-google-scholar-square si-3x\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\nNote: Each icon also has an associated -square icon to enable better integration with the square Font Awesome icons."

Before submitting a request, please check that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nThe logo/icon requested is of appropriate dimensions (roughly square).\n\nIf that doesn’t exist, then there’s really not much that can be done, and the request will have to be ignored until such time that a (squarish) logo/icon can be provided.\n\nAn icon of appropriate resolution can be provided or linked to.\n\nThe provided file must be a vector file (e.g. SVG, EPS, AI) or a PDF with the vector file embedded.\nThese files are all very easy to work with, and result in the most faithful reproductions of the icon.\nI don’t have time to convert high resolution raster images (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF), so any requests that aren’t in a vector format will be closed.\n\nThe icon can be reduced to monochrome.\n\nThis is one of the basic requirements of a versatile icon, but it is often overlooked when icons are made by people who are not professional designers. Academia is full of unprofessional designers, and it is sometimes the case that a logo relies entirely on the use of different colours.\nIn certain cases we can be creative (see the dblp logo), but more often than not it will be impossible to create a monochrome version of the icon. Feel free to make the request, but it will probably be ignored if an alternate logo cannot be found."
